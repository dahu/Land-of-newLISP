Land of newLISP
---------------

http://landoflisp.com/[Land of Lisp] is an accessible and friendly book about
lisp, with cartoons and aliens. It's good. I like it.

But... it uses Common Lisp. And I don't like that so much.

So, this little repo holds newLISP versions of some of the Common Lisp examples
from the book.

A big thanks to Conrad Barski for giving his blessing on this work.
